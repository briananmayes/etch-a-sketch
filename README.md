# Etch-A-Sketch
A JavaScript project part of The Odin Project's [JavaScript Fundamentals Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

This project is a digital version of etch-a-sketch where a user can 'sketch' a pixelated drawing by moving their mouse over the squares in the grid. When a user clicks the 'Reset Grid' button, the user is prompted to input the number of squares or dimensions of the grid. 

# Demo
The project can be viewed and demoed [here](https://briananmayes.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).
